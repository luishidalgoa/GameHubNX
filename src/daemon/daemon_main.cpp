 * and 15k lines of engine into that first launch buys nothing.
 *
 * Everything here that looks arbitrary was paid for by a hardware run of
 * src/probe — see docs/plans/SYSMODULE_PROBE_RESULTS.md §6.
 *
 * Build:   make daemon
 * Install: copy build-switch/daemon/atmosphere/... to the SD root, then
 *          enable "pipensx" in ovlSysmodules (no reboot).
 * Check:   curl -s http://<switch-ip>:8080/api/info

 * 4.7 MiB in use; the engine needs an order of magnitude more, and stream
 * install needs more still (see the reserve floor in stream_ram_budget.cpp).
 *
 * Asked for as a *ceiling*, not a demand: a static array of this size is bss,
 * and the kernel refuses to create a process whose bss the pool cannot cover
 * — silently, with the module stuck "off" in ovlSysmodules and no crash
 * report. Claiming the heap at runtime and stepping down until the kernel
 * says yes removes that failure entirely and turns the ceiling into one
 * boot's worth of measurement instead of a bisection over console reboots.
 * /api/info reports asked vs granted.
 *
 * Measured on hardware: a 32 MiB-bss build stayed "off" while the probe
 * (4 MiB bss, same card, same loader, DBI closed) started normally. bss is
 * the difference, and it is the pool that refuses it.

/*
 * The ceiling on *this* heap, and why none of the obvious levers move it. It
 * is not the ceiling on the daemon's memory: see claimMemletMemory() below,
 * which gets 128 MiB from somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * Measured 2026-07-29, HOS 22.5.0 — every one of these gave the same 6 MiB:
 *
 *   ask 32 MiB / ask 128 MiB          memTotalBytes 6815744
 *   pool_partition 1 (Applet)         6815744
 *   pmshellBoostSystemMemoryResourceLimit(128 MiB), rc=0     6815744
 *   both together                     7077888
 *   every other homebrew sysmodule unloaded                  8388608
 *
 * memTotalBytes is not a per-process allowance, it is "what this process
 * holds plus what is still free in the shared System resource limit" — which
 * is why unloading the neighbours moved it and nothing else did.
 *
 * The limit is Atmosphère's, and it already does the thing that looks like
 * the fix: it shrinks the APPLET pool (eShop, album, web applet) and hands
 * that memory to SYSTEM so more custom sysmodules fit. Firmware 20.0.0 capped
 * that steal at 14 MB, down from 40 — for every custom sysmodule on the
 * console combined. So the boost has nothing left to take, which is exactly
 * how it returns rc=0 and changes nothing. There is no setting: Atmosphère
 * PR #697 proposed one and was rejected because pm sets resource limits
 * before set:sys exists.
 *
 * The boost code is gone; keeping a call that provably does nothing, holds
 * system-wide state past process exit and costs a pm:shell capability was the
 * worse trade. (It is not quite a no-op — on 5.0.0+ pm implements it as
 * SetUnsafeLimit, which opens svcMapPhysicalMemoryUnsafe against the
 * Application pool rather than growing the System limit. That is a second way
 * in, unexplored, and worse than memlet's: it takes from the pool games run
 * in, and cannot be raised while one is running.)

 * The way around the ceiling above, and it is not the System pool at all.

 * `memlet` is an Atmosphere sysmodule (TID 0100000000000421) added in 1.9.0 so
 * ams.mitm could build romfs after firmware 20.0.0 took its memory away. It
 * declares pool_partition 1, so it belongs to the APPLET resource-limit group,
 * and its single command creates a shared memory out of that group's 507 MiB
 * and moves the handle to the caller. Mapping a shared memory costs the mapper
 * nothing, so the memory is charged to memlet and never touches the ~7-14 MiB
 * that all custom sysmodules on the console share.
 *
 * The applet pool is also not the pool games run in (that is Application), so
 * holding this does not shrink a running game.
 *
 * Command 65000: in u64 desired size, out granted size + move handle. memlet
 * caps at 128 MiB, requires MiB alignment and steps its own answer down 1 MiB
 * at a time until the pool covers it — so asking for the cap measures the
 * ceiling in a single boot and there is no knob worth adding here.
 *
 * Internal API with no stability promise, and the memory competes with
 * ams.mitm's romfs builder (large game mods). Every failure path below leaves
 * the daemon running on its own heap.
 *
 * Measured 2026-07-31, HOS 22.5.0, AMS with memlet present: asked 128 MiB,
 * granted 128 MiB, both end pages read back what was written. The whole ask
 * was met, so this is memlet's own cap and not the applet pool's — the pool
 * had more to give. Twenty-one times the System-pool heap, from a service
 * that was already installed.
